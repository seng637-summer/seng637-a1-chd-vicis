# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

In this lab SENG-637 team 1 performed software testing on an ATM simulation system which can be found [here](https://github.com/seng637-summer/seng637-a1-chd-vicis/blob/main/seng637-a1-artifacts.zip).  The main purpose of the lab was to take the lessons and techniques learned in the lectures and apply them them in a practical software testing scenario.  The team's main goal when testing was to find and document as many bugs as possible and so performed testing in three phases: exploratory, manual function testing and regression testing.  All stages of testing were documented using the Jira platform 

Before the lab the team was familiar with the concepts of exploratory from the class lectures but possessed no practical experience.  The only testing experience within the group was from ad-hoc testing while creating programs during 


exploratory, manual function testing and regression testing on a simulated ATM application.  The main goal of the lab was to take what was learned in the lectures and apply the techniques learned onto a real software system.  :
-   To gain practical experience testing a piece of software and connect what was taught in class
-  Understand and expereince exploratory, manual scripted, and regression testing
-   Obtain experience with a professional and industry used issues tracking software




testing  The group was familiar with exploratory and manual functional testing from the class lectures but possessed no practical experience.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Below summarizes the groups test plan for exploratory testing followed by the two pair groups.  As testing was performed issues were created in jira to log potential bugs.

General Approach
1. Read and understand the system's high level requirements found in Appendix B and make note of potential areas for bugs 
2. Familiarization with the ATM System - perform a single run-through via a transaction (deposit) as described in the README
3. Explore standard functionalities of a user such as performing transactions
4. Explore standard functionalities of an operator such as entering how many $20 bills are in the ATM
5. Explore non-standard functionalities and attempt operations that shouldn't be allowed

Test Cases & ATM Requirements Targeted
Card Validation & Pin Verification
-    Test valid card
-    Test invalid card
-    Test valid card and valid PIN
-    Test valid card with invalid PIN
-    Test card retention after three consecutive invalid PIN attempts

Cash Withdrawal
-    Test successful and insufficient balance cash withdrawal from valid savings, checking, and money market accounts

Deposit Processing
-    Test deposit to all the valid accounts

Money Transfer
-    Test successful transfer between two valid accounts
-    Test transfer with an invalid source or destination account
-    Test transfer with insufficient balance

Balance Inquiry
-    Test balance inquiry for a invalid accound
-    Test balance inquiry for an invalid account

Transaction Cancellation
-    Test transaction cancellation using the Cancel key
-    Test transaction cancellation at various stages (withdrawal, deposit, transfer)

User Interface
-    Test keyboard input for all transaction types
-    Test display output for transaction status, prompts, and error messages

Receipt Generation
-    Test receipt generation for successful transactions
-    Test receipt content for accuracy (date, time, location, transaction details, balances)

    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
