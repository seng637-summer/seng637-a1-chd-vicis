# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

In this lab SENG-637 team 1 performed software testing on an ATM simulation system which can be found [here](https://github.com/seng637-summer/seng637-a1-chd-vicis/blob/main/seng637-a1-artifacts.zip).  The main purpose of the lab was to take the lessons and techniques learned in the lectures and apply them them in a practical software testing scenario.  The team's main goal when testing was to find and document as many bugs as possible and so performed testing in three phases: exploratory, manual function testing and regression testing.  All stages of testing were documented using the Jira platform 

Before the lab the team was familiar with the concepts of exploratory from the class lectures but possessed no practical experience.  The only testing experience within the group was from ad-hoc testing while creating programs during 


exploratory, manual function testing and regression testing on a simulated ATM application.  The main goal of the lab was to take what was learned in the lectures and apply the techniques learned onto a real software system.  :
-   To gain practical experience testing a piece of software and connect what was taught in class
-  Understand and expereince exploratory, manual scripted, and regression testing
-   Obtain experience with a professional and industry used issues tracking software




testing  The group was familiar with exploratory and manual functional testing from the class lectures but possessed no practical experience.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Below summarizes the groups test plan for exploratory testing followed by the two pair groups.
General Approach
1. Familiarization with the ATM System
2.    


Test Cases & ATM Requirements Targeted
Card Validation & Pin Verification
-    Test valid card
-    Test invalid card
-    Test valid card and valid PIN


# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
