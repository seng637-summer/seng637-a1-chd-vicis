# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

In this lab, Team 1 of SENG-637 conducted software testing on an ATM simulation system, which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/seng637-summer/seng637-a1-chd-vicis/blob/main/seng637-a1-artifacts.zip).  The primary objective of the lab was to apply the lessons and techniques learned in the lectures to a practical software testing scenario. The team focused on achieving three specific goals:
1. Acquire practical experience in testing a software system
2. Understand and gain experience in three different types of testing: exploratory, manual scripted, and regression testing
3. Utilize and become familiar with a professional issue tracking system such as Jira 

Throughout the lab, the team successfully conducted exploratory, manual scripted, and regression testing, which resulted in the discovery of 21 unique bugs. These bugs were documented using Jira, a professional issue tracking system. The team found the experience of using Jira valuable, collaborated on pair testing for the first time, and composed practical bug reports. Additionally, they gained insights into the strengths and weaknesses of various testing approaches and how they complement each other.

Before undertaking this lab, the team members had a theoretical understanding of software testing from the class lectures but lacked practical experience. Their testing experience was limited to ad-hoc testing while developing programs during undergraduate and graduate courses. Furthermore, the team had no prior exposure to a professional issue tracker such as Jira.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Below summarizes the groups test plan for exploratory testing followed by the two pair groups.  As testing was performed issues were created in jira to log potential bugs.

General Approach
1. Read and understand the system's high level requirements found in Appendix B and make note of potential areas for bugs 
2. Familiarization with the ATM System - perform a single run-through via a transaction (deposit) as described in the README
3. Explore standard functionalities of a user such as performing transactions
4. Explore standard functionalities of an operator such as entering how many $20 bills are in the ATM
5. Explore non-standard functionalities and attempt operations that shouldn't be allowed

Test Cases & ATM Requirements Targeted
Card Validation & Pin Verification
-    Test valid card
-    Test invalid card
-    Test valid card and valid PIN
-    Test valid card with invalid PIN
-    Test card retention after three consecutive invalid PIN attempts

Cash Withdrawal
-    Test successful and insufficient balance cash withdrawal from valid savings, checking, and money market accounts

Deposit Processing
-    Test deposit to all the valid accounts

Money Transfer
-    Test successful transfer between two valid accounts
-    Test transfer with an invalid source or destination account
-    Test transfer with insufficient balance

Balance Inquiry
-    Test balance inquiry for a invalid accound
-    Test balance inquiry for an invalid account

Transaction Cancellation
-    Test transaction cancellation using the Cancel key
-    Test transaction cancellation at various stages (withdrawal, deposit, transfer)

User Interface
-    Test keyboard input for all transaction types
-    Test display output for transaction status, prompts, and error messages

Receipt Generation
-    Test receipt generation for successful transactions
-    Test receipt content for accuracy (date, time, location, transaction details, balances)

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
